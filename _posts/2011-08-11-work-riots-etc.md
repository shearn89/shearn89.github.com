# Work, riots, etc. #

As some of you may have noticed, there are major riots in the UK at the moment. These apparently started in protest at the shooting of suspected gangster Mark Duggan by the police. What started with a peaceful protest by the people affected (local residents in Tottenham) has spread to general criminality. I'm not impressed. I had a small argument/debate with a friend last night when he posted the news that Manchester City council will evict any rioters found to be living in council houses. I mentioned that this might work, as it would probably make people think twice about opportunistic looting. He brought up human rights, and I pointed out that anyone "rebelling" against the state for no apparent reason other than "to show the police what we're capable of" shouldn't be supported by the state. He tried to tell me there were complex reasons behind the riots, and that poverty was a good excuse. I said he was talking rubbish, and played my +5 vigilante cat card.

Work is going fine - took my laptop in today, so we basically have an any-music jukebox set up in the room we're building the machines in. It rocks.

That is all.
