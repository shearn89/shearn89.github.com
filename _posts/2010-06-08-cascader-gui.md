# Cascader-GUI #

Short note: Xoebus made a program to make getting help in the labs easier. It was writtenin ruby. I thought I’d learn ruby, so I did, and made a GUI for it. Still working on packaging it for DICE, but if you add your hostname to one of the host files included, you can test it at home. You’ll need ruby-gnome2, which I’ll link here once I’m at a computer, and git. And ruby.
Get it here: github.com/shearn89/cascader-gui
Or as part of xoebus’ at-tools: github.com/xoebus/at-tools

Side note: on the train to Manchester for Parklife! Check out the lineup: parklife.uk.com/line_ups.php
(I think that’s the link…)
