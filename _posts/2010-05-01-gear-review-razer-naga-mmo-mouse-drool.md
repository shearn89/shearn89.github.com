# Gear Review: Razer Naga MMO Mouse. *Drool* #

So, the promised review of my shiny new naga mouse!

I&#8217;ve had this mouse for about a week or so now, and I have to say, it rocks! I also got myself a razer mousepad to go with it, which makes it so smooth to move, it&#8217;s effortless. It&#8217;s very much an MMO mouse - the number pad on the side has 12 buttons, which act as either the top row numbers on the keyboard, or the numpad. It has high dpi, and although it lacks the on-the-fly buttons for changing the sensitivity, these are bindable using the bundled software. The handy addon for the interface is simply a branded version of free UI addon [Dominoshttp://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/dominos.aspx] ,  and is actually fairly easy to set up for anyone used to interface customisation.

Here’s some shots of the mouse, and the stuff it comes bundled with.

The mouse, with numberpad clearly visible:

The stuff: quick start guide, in depth guide, catalog, trainer bobbles (read on for more info), stickers, certificate of authenticity, and a postcard…

I play 2 classes mainly - a Death Knight and a Shaman (which I only recently started), and it&#8217;s brilliant for both. Its made tanking so much easier, since I can now move freely using WSAD, and still control the fight as needed. DPS is also good, especially in mobile fights (Rotface in ICC, Ick and Krick in the 5-mans). I&#8217;ve also started healing with the Shaman, and although that&#8217;s much less mobile, coupled with the healing addon I use [VuhDohttp://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/vuhdo.aspx] , the sheer number of buttons available is astonishing.

The number keys are around the size of those of a mobile phone keypad from a few years back, and at first knowing which button you’re thumb is on can be tricky. To solve this, Razer bundle in some “trainers”, which are little rubber pads that you stick onto the keys. There’s small rectangular ones which are quite large and provide plenty of tactile feedback, and some smaller dots. I had a dot on the 5 button, and a rectangle on the 7 button until just today, and now find it very intuitive without them. The bottom row of buttons (10-12) are quite tricky to reach, so most of my well-used spells and abilities are bound to the more easy-to-reach ones: 1-3, 4, 5, and 7. Using these with ctrl/alt/shift modifiers means I have plenty of options!

So, with no more ado, here are some screenshots, and some notes on the setup used! Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions or would like to know more.
