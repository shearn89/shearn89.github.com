# Revision or Procrastination? #

I'm meant to be revising. Instead, I'm finding a shedload of aweseom links on the internet, some of which are new, some of which arent!

Most of them are in my [twitter feed](http://twitter.com/shearn89) at some point, so for up-to-date info, follow me on there. But there're some great ones on Youtube: search for things like "baby monkey rides a pig", "the art of flight", "surfer fail", and "boss nigger", to name a few. That last one might be mildly racist, but it's made in the 70s, so it might just be acceptable. Is that how it works? Dunno.
