# Mmmm, summer... #

Sooo, I finished exams last Wednesday, and have only just emerged from a haze of sunshine, bbqs, and drinking. It's been totally epic: CompSoc mini-bbq on Wednesday afternoon, all day in the Meadows on Thursday, same again on Friday. Couple of more chilled days Saturday/Sunday, then a brilliant 21st party up in Kinross on Monday/Tuesday.

It's been pretty brilliant, and an awesome end to the year - getting to see everyone and just hang out has easily been the best bit, and the fantastic weather simply makes it better. I've now got about 4 days to tidy, pack, and clean the flat, and then I'm back off down south on Monday (31st). Back to rainy Marlborough...

Summer plans: Manchester for [festivals](http://parklife.uk.com/line_ups.php)  [in](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=121453587883719)  [June](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=324587308619&amp;ref=share) , then back home, London for another 21st, Oxford for yet another, a friend's wedding, and finally [work](http://www.mcsummerschool.org.uk/) from July 7th - August 7th. Busy busy busy! I also need to pass a driving test in there somewhere.

Here's some cool music (on youtube):
