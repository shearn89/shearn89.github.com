# Exams are almost done! #

[So nearly there](http://howlonguntil.com/may/21/2011/04:30pm), I can taste it...

So, 2 exmas left. Literally can't wait for the week after: I plan to get nice and drunk, and generally just chill out. It's even more awesome that there's a huge number of awesome events on after exams:

- Big Cheese/Hospitality
- Crookers
- Musique Boutique IV
- Friend's Birthday Dinner
- Friend's Actual Birthday
- Other Friend's Birthday

...and then we're into June and there's trips to Wales, a 21st, Beach Break Live (omg I'm so excited for this).

The summer is going to ROCK.

Also, this song is awesome: [Nas & Damian Marley - Patience](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9VQye6P8k0).

So yeah. This summer will be awesome, and it starts in about 88 hours...

Peace.
