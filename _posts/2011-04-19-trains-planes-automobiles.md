# Trains, Planes, Automobiles #

On the train back up to Edinburgh. Had a fairly chilled few days with 
my grandparents: they have a fairly hefty stock of alcohol that never
gets drunk, so I helped with that! Got a little work done: some 
revision, and some web design. The web design has been coming along
nicely, and should be up soon.

I've also been doing some continuing work on this site, so if you
thought you noticed stuff changing, you probably did!

Lastly, I've started work on the [webapp idea](/blog/posts/new-webapp-idea/)
I mentioned, so stay tuned. I happen to think it's not half bad, so as
long as I can code it up alright, it should turn out okay!

As always, I'll keep you posted...
