# Proper start of work #

Just got back from a very quick trip back up to Edinburgh to grab all my stuff: managed to do both journeys in 5hrs 30 of actual driving, with another hour each way for lunch/breakfast. Pretty impressive.

So now all my stuff is piled up at home, and I have my gaming rig back. Which is great, except I started work on Wednesday last week, and it's now fairly solid until mid-August... Installing and configuring school machines til Friday, then on the 4th Summer School starts for 4 weeks of moving furniture and driving milkfloats! Should be hilarious, just like last year (see the posts about rubbish parking etc)...

After that, there's another couple of weeks of machine installation, a week of chill/projects/websites, and then back to the Burgh for the festival! Roll on year 4...
