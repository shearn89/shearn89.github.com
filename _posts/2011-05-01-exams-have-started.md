# Exams have started! #

Actually, they're like a week in. Had 3 last week, then a day off, then the Royal Wedding (loved it), and another 3 next week.
They went fairly well: IVR was good, surprisingly. Logic programming was pretty terrible, and I reckon I can get a maximum of 30% on that paper...
Not so good! However, the theory paper was good, so hey. We'll se how it goes.

Then there was the Royal Wedding, which was awesome and hilarious: I played Wizards Staff, and reached level 12. BOOM. I did however feel rough yesterday, and got no work done.

Soooo, back on the work: revising NAT ready for wednesday. Going well so far, and hopefully it'll be no real trouble.

Good luck if you've got exams! I'll most likely write some more when I get bored of work...
