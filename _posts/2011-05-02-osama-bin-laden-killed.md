# Osama Bin Laden Killed #

Just heard on the news that the USA has finally killed Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan! What a weekend... There is the mild oddity that they buried him at sea, but apart from that, I'm generally pretty happy about this!

I thought I'd collect some great quotes from Twitter:

> A prince gets married, the bad guy is dead. It's a real Disney weekend here on earth. #osama #obl -- [@RevRunJnr](twitter.com/@RevRunJnr)

> And why have they buried Osama Bin Laden at sea? That didn't work for Megatron. -- [@missmei](twitter.com/@missmei)

> The awkward thing about #osama is that nobody is telling you that Dora The Explorer was the one who finally found him... -- [@Lord_Voldemort7](twitter.com/@Lord_Voldemort7)

> so #Jack Bauer finally got his man #osama -- [@Darrenruddick](twitter.com/@Darrenruddick)

> So Bin Larden is finally dead. It's amazing what the Americans can do when the playstation network is down. #Osama -- [@da2montero](twitter.com/@da2montero)

> Osama is dead. Excellent reason to get absolutely hammered. Ooh, Team America's trending. My Monday's sorted =D -- [@Bethnyspears](twitter.com/@Bethnyspears)
