# week 2, full steam ahead #

It's half way through week 2 of my final semester. I'm excited, but I also have a 10 page report to write for Friday, which kinda sucks.

[My project](http://project.shearn89.com) is going very well! Up and running, got some basic estimation working, trying to tweak things to make them better. Go check it out, if you're an Edinburgh student you'll find it useful!

I've been spending far too much money recently, and failing to save it. I've also literally just had a phone call from natwest about fraud prevention, eek!

But, my BT graduate placement application is going well - I'm off to an assessment day *on my birthday*, which sucks a little bit, but is still quite epic. Hopefully all will work out, and I'll have an actual proper job come September...

Other than that, I should stop procrastinating and get back to work. I'll leave you with this youtube video, it totally rocks.

Laters y'all...
