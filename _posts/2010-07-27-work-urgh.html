Sooo, it's been ages since I last posted something, mostly cos it's a biatch to get on tumblr at home.

Holidays so far:

1. Trip to Manchester
2. 21st in London
3. 21st in Oxford
4. Wedding in Oxford
5. Work! For like a month.

All was good, work is okay: I'm teaching elderly people how to use a mouse and send email. It's a little painful, but bearable and awesome pay. That's only part of my job: the main part is heavy lifting and driving milkfloats! I'll post some photos up at some point.

I also failed 2 of my maths modules, so on the 14th of August I'll be heading back up to Edinburgh for a couple of weeks. Resits, festival, chill time. Should be awesome.

I've also been working on some coding stuff with <a href="http://xoebus.heroku.com/">xoebus</a>. When github released it's organisations stuff, we set up <a href="http://lolsoft.github.com">LolSoft</a> (no prizes for guessing where the name comes from!). We've been working mostly on the <b>at-tools</b> suite, which is designed to make working in AT much easier. It's gone fairly well, and I've been learning a lot.
I'm also working on a program called <a href="http://github.com/shearn89/inthelabs">inthelabs</a>, which should allow you to see who's in the labs at any point, via a web frontend or the gui client. Currently its built in Ruby, with a Rails frontend. I hope to use facebook connect at some point to allow users to login and see which friends are in the labs. Perhaps even in the long run I'll write an iphone app or something. We'll see.

Lastly, #gear! I'm going to buy a macbook in September. It'll be badass.
