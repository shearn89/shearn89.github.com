# End of term, Coursework, Christmas #

Wow, it's been absolutely ages since my last post! Well, quite a lot has happened since then. There's been ups and downs, a mixture of awesome times and less awesome times. I finally reached the end of term and handed in all my coursework, although I didn't get into the ITO to pick up marks before I came home for the holidays. I gave my second group presentation about [my project](http://shearn89.com/project/), and then I came home.

As well as all the academic stuff, I applied for a job as a ski rep (which I didn't get), met someone awesome (which didn't work out), saw [The Correspondents](http://thecorrespondents.co.uk/) (who ROCK), started applying for a job with BT (which is going well), went to an epic Christmas dinner with my sister, and obviously made it through Christmas with the family! Phew...

Had some stress over Christmas with the grandparents - my Grandfather had a tooth out, but because he's getting quite elderly there were some complications, and he spent 3.5 hours in A+E on Christmas Eve. Not ideal! My parents and sister and I all went to midnight mass on Christmas Eve: the first time I'd ever been. It definitely made me feel a whole lot more festive, which given my distinct Grinchy-ness over the last few days was a big help. The grandparents still made it over here on Christmas day though, and they absolutely adored their presents...

Sooo, over the next couple of weeks before term starts again I have to:
1. **Do more project work.** I need to get my prediction algorithm working before the start of term, even if it's crude and inaccurate.
2. **Confirm the details for our new flatmate.** One of my flatmates is moving to Derby for an Engineering placement, so we've got a new one moving in. He might be French. We're still working on it.
3. **Get fitter.** Found some slightly gimmicky 100 pushups app. I'm trying to stick with it to see if it makes a difference, given that it only takes about half an hour every couple of days. If I can, I might try and start running next term (yes, I did say *running*. I might be going mad.)

That's about it really! I'll leave you with some of my twitter and youtube highlights from the past two months...
