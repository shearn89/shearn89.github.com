# Stuff to learn over the summer #

In the style of [@oetzi](http://oetzi101.tumblr.com/post/4802528380/summer-of-knowledge), here's a list of stuff I want to get better at over the summer:

1. **Rails**. I want to complete the mysterious webapp I've been planning, which is in Rails at the mo.
2. **Rake**. I like automating stuff, and I like ruby. Rake seems like a great combo of the two.
3. **iOS**. App development is awesome and profitable. Gief skillz.
4. **RDF**. Since my project next year is on linked data and RDF stuff, I'm going to need to read a bit about it. Maybe find some project that uses it.

Boom. Maybe I'll add some more stuff to this list later, maybe not...
