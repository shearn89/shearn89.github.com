<h2>Exams!</h2>
<p>First exam today: Inf2b. Not so good. It turned out that the questions I thought would be easy were hard, and the hard questions weren't so bad: however, I ran out of time and barely answered the 4th question, meaning out of a possible 75 marks, I need 40 to pass. Not sure that's gonna happen...</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Linear Algebra, which is actually okay (judging by past papers). As long as it isn't a repeat of today, I'll be sorted!</p>
<h2>Music!</h2>
<p>LOVING the new <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/stylo-feat-mos-def-bobby-womack/id358108041?i=358108101&uo=6" target="itunes_store">Gorillaz Album!</a> It's just awesomely funky, and the fact that it has collaborations from Snoop Dogg, Bashy, Kano, Mos Def, De La Soul, and Lou Reed, just makes it even better. Definitely best listened to as a whole though, and not as singles.</p>
<p>Also, some cool singles to listen to (these are iTunes links, but look them up on youtube if you like):<!-- more -->

<h3>Quotes!</h3>
<p>Awesome quote that I heard (again) recently:</p>
<p><i>"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn't serve the world. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."</i><b>-- Marianne Williamson</b>, often attributed to Nelson Mandela.</p>
