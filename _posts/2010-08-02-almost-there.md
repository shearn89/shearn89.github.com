# Almost there... #

Monday of week 3. Already had complaints about our alphabetisation ("It's under t for 'the'? But that's ridiculous! It should be under c for china or r for restoration!" - bloke raging when he couldn't find "the care and restoration of china', in strict alphabetical order). Also had the same nutter trying to show off how much technical know-how he has (not as much as the director of IT), and some verrrry slow grannies on the course.

Somehow, I think this'll be a sloooow week. I'm not happy about it.
