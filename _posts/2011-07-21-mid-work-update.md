# Mid-work update #

It's just past the half way mark for my work at Marlborough Summer School, so I thought I'd post a brief update. My twitter usage has totally stopped, mainly because I'm no longer constantly at a computer! Plus, it's too much hassle to carry my ipod around all the time, especially when I can't listen to music on headphones. Work has been fine, it's been raining plenty, and I've managed to avoid doing too much IT tutoring, which means I'm generally less tired and less grumpy... Definitely a good thing!

Looking forward to getting paid, and then getting back up to the Burgh for a few days: Jimmy Eat World on the 25th Aug! Woop!
