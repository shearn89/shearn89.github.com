# HTML5 Boilerplate hacking #

During a little revision break, I hacked together my own fork of the [html5boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com). It includes [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), [compass](http://compass-style.org/), and a [sticky css footer](http://www.cssstickyfooter.com/). Feel free to take a look, use it, fork it, hack it, and send me pull requests for updates.

I figured it was easier than constantly combining everything everytime I started a new site/page/whatever...
