# FESTIVAL #

Actually, a week in Wales followed by a Festival. Tenby was absolutely fantastic, if a little hard on the liver. Beach Break Live was SO DAMN GOOD OH MY GOD I LOVE FESTIVALS. There're photos on my [facebook profile](http://www.facebook.com/shearn89) if you're friends with me. If not, tough. I also made a [Grooveshark Playlist](http://grooveshark.com/#/playlist/Beach+Break+2011/55380031) of the music that we were chilling to at the campsite. I'll probs put together one of the artists that I saw and liked at some point in the next few days, so keep an eye out...

In the meantime, as per some of my recent tweets, I seriously recommend that everyone gets [Ed Sheeran's](http://www.edsheeran.com/) new EP, as it's free and has 3 absolutely fantastic tracks on it. Also buy his single that's in the UK charts, it's great.

Lastly, go listen to [The Anomalies](http://soundcloud.com/the-anomalies) on soundcloud: saw them in one of the bar tents and they were soooo good!

Feeling like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3X38hhr4a4) right now. So happy.
