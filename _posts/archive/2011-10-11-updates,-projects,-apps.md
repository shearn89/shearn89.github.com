# Updates, projects, apps #

It's been a busy week or so up here in Edinburgh. I had coursework last week, which was due in yesterday. I thought it had all gone well, until Monday morning when I realised it was totally screwed, and I had to spend a panicky few hours getting it as fixed as possible! This was all made somewhat harder by an awesome weekend at Appathon Edinburgh as part of svc2uk.

Appathon was, however, totally awesome. We had a fairly decent idea, and although we didn't get it fully working in the 30 hours we had, we made a good effort, and I'm hoping to carry on with it if I get time over the next few weeks. The idea was to map crime hotspots against bus stop locations, so that you could find a safe route to the nearest bus stop when you're on a night out in a city you may be unfamiliar with! We called it StreetBuddy, so if I get anything up and running over the next few weeks I'll let you all know...

My project is going fairly well: I now have access to weekly snapshots of data on the machines in Appleton, and I'll be meeting someone next week who can try and set up data that's 'live' to within 15 minutes. Hopefully, again in a couple of weeks, I'll have a working prototype up...

Sooo... Busy next few weeks as well: EUSSC Freshers Rep elections on Thursday, parents up here next Friday, Sister and Boyfriend up here the Wednesday after that, SNOFresh in Glasgow on the 19th... ARGH! Frantic!

Coursework deadlines also come in a steady stream over the next few weeks as well. Looks like updates to the blog might go slowly over the next while.

Stay tuned to my twitter feed for more frequent and personal posts!

Peace y'all.
