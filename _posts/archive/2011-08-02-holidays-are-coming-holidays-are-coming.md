# Holidays are coming, Holidays are coming #

Well, work ended on Saturday. It was great this year: a whole different crowd of people, and all really nice. Plus, a fair few local people, meaning that the group of "friends to go to the pub with" is now much bigger!

I've spent the last 2 days sleeping mostly, and my parents left on holiday for 2 weeks today, so I now have the house to myself. It's lovely and quiet...

More work starts on Thursday, doing the same old installing computers thing I was doing before Summer School. Couple of weeks of that, and I plan to be back in the Burgh on the 21st or so...

Woop! Enjoy the last days of the summer...
