# Jobs and Thoughts #
It's been a few weeks since my last blog post, so I figured it's time to
do another. A surprising amount has happened in the last few weeks: I had 
an offer for the job I applied for with BT, which is seriously good news!
 So as of September I'll be working in Ipswich, which is perfect, as I'm 
not spending money on living in London, but am still perfectly able to get
to London to see gigs and the like. Best of both worlds!

I've also been ploughing on with coursework and project: the project is 
nearing completion, with some estimation working, and some other nice 
features. [Go take a look!](http://project.shearn89.com)

My parents have been up here this week, which has been a really nice break. 
They're not staying in the usual cottage, but one a bit easier to get to 
which is out at Cramond. I stayed out there on Tuesday, and it's absolutely
stunning: so nice to be able to see the sea while you're working!

I finally got a new ski jacket to replace the one that I lost at the start 
of term: an awesome one from Westbeach. It's the Maverick jacket in Heli-red,
 which is 3 horizontal block stripes in red/purple/yellow down the jacket. 
Next time I head out skiing I'll get some photos!

I've also had a cool webapp idea, which I'm planning to use as an excercise 
in learning about receiving mail in Rails, and also writing tests in RSpec 
for Rails. I'll announce it properly once I've actually done some work on 
it...

Anyways, I'll leave you with some interesting reading/music/whatever:
