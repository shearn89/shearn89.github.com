# Skyrim Needs Some Patches #

So, I bought Skyrim a few days ago. Absolutely loving it. Also, after having downloaded a 1GB update from Steam, surprisingly bug free! I'm playing a Mage/Thief type character, with perk points going into: Destruction, Restoration, Alchemy, Enchanting, Lockpicking, some in Sneak, some in Pickpocketing. I tend to nuke stuff with Firebolts, and sneak around otherwise. So much more fun than Morrowind was to play as a mage, although I never got hugely into Oblivion (didn't buy it til sometime last year).

So anyway. Mostly bug free, until now... I've just run through the Staff of Magnus quest, in a dungeon called Labyrinthian. All was going well, except the video stattered to judder, so I saved and reloaded in the hope that it would fix it. It did, kinda, except that then I got some seeerious bugs.

1. The ghosts, apart from Samos (or w/e his name is), stopped appearing, so I only had half a conversation.
2. The ominous voice stopped working properly, so I got the graphic effect (most of the time, but not always), and the mana debuff, but no speech.
3. When I reached the end bit, I took out the 2 mages from Sneak, which freed Morokei, but then he didn't see me because I was hidden. I snuck up on him, used my ice-shout thing, and then hammered him with dual-wield fireballs. Now, I was expecting a bit more competition than I had, as he barely seemed to react at all. Admittedly, with the Impact perk dual wield spells are pretty OP, but I still. I didn't take **ANY DAMAGE AT ALL**. I was amazed. It just felt a bit bugged, as I was sure it shouldn't have been that easy: he didn't move, and he barely seemed to try to cast any spells. V. surprising.

So, yeah. I can't wait for the Creation Kit to be released in a few weeks, as I can get to work tweaking broken stuff, and adding chests to my houses...
