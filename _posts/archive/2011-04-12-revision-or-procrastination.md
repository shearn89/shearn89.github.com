# Revision or Procrastination #

I'm meant to be revising. Instead, I'm finding a shedload of aweseom links on the internet, some of which are new, some of which arent!

Most of them are in my [twitter feed](http://twitter.com/shearn89) at some point, so for up-to-date info, follow me on there. But there're some great ones on Youtube: search for things like "baby monkey rides a pig", "the art of flight", "surfer fail".
