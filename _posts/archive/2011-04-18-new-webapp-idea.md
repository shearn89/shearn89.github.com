# New webapp idea #

I came up with a brill idea for a webapp, partly as a way of procrastiating. Can't tell you what it is yet,
but I can say it'll involve Ruby, Rails, Social Media, Politics, and mayb eventully something snazzy like
natural language processing. To start with though, it'll be pretty simple...

More info to come sometime soon!

Peace.
