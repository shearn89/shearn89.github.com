# Cascader-GUI and inthelabs are coming to DICE! #

Just got a reply from DICE tech support about my email. I asked if it was possible for ruby-gnome2 to be installed on the DICE machines, allowing us to run GUI programs built for our at-tools suite.

Their reply:

“We’re both in luck: the ruby-gnome2 library will be installed by default
on the new Fedora 13 lab machines; they’re already installed (minus many
research & teaching packages so far) in one lab in AT, and before the
start of semester will be rolled out across the lab.

$ rpm -qi ruby-gnome2
Name        : ruby-gnome2
Version     : 0.19.4
Release     : 2.fc13
[…]

An example F13 machine is ‘tulla’, on which you might be able to
remotely test your tools.”

Ahhhh yeah! I’ll give it a test this afternoon…
