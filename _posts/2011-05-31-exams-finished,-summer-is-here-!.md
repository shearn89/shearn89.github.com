# Exams finished, Summer is HERE! #

Exams finished a while ago now. Well, about 10 days ago. Since then, I've accomplished practically nothing at all, except to have an awesome weekend: various birthday's and nights out have made the last 10 days totally epic.

On the train home. Only just caught it, thanks to ridiculous traffic in the city centre, and me having waaaay too many bags. All sorted now though, quiet few hours til Birmingham, a change, and then on to Cheltenham and HOME. Can't wait.

Enjoy summer, I'll update with cool stuff as and when...
