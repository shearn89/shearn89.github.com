Well, I'm back in the shire... So far, the Internet is as crap as it always was (uber restricted), the parents are generally slightly grumpy (as always), but the weather is incredible (definitely not normal). Glorious sunshine unfortunately doesn't lend itself to actually doing much though, so tidying up all my stuff from uni, sorting out old clothes, and clearing the garage is definitely not fun! Ah well.

I've also recently started playing EVE online, which is so far epic. Totally different to WoW, but nonetheless good. It's a lot more open, and a lot more complicated - you can do anything you want, the missions are mostly there to provide a tutorial, and something for combat pilots to do. I may well subscribe come September.
