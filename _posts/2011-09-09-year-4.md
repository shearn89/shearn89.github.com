# Year 4 #

It's the end of summer (although I'm not sure it ever really started), and next week is Freshers' Week. I'm currently trying to pack up stuff that's lying around the house, and get organised for a meeting with my [project supervisor](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ewan/) next week. My plan is to have some questions to ask, and maybe try and get some milestones and a timeline sorted, so that I have some idea of where I'm starting the project. Its on RDF databases: converting the current Informatics department data from the format its in at the moment into RDF, which is the format of [the semantic web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web). It should be cool! I'm looking forward to it at least...

Other than that, I had an awesome week or so in Edinburgh for the festival, saw Jimmy Eat World (WHO ROCKED!), and some other stuff. Chilled out, moved in to the new flat, etc etc... Off to Surrey this weekend for a 21st, and flying back up to the Burgh on Tuesday!

I'm surprisingly excited about this year, even though it's my last, and might be mental. We'll see.

So yeah. Should be a good one. I'll just leave this here: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WavRrPgqqGw](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WavRrPgqqGw).
