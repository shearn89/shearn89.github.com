SO! Yes, it's been a very long time since I last posted anything on here, (apart from the SDP thingy). A lot has happened, and I'll try to keep it short(ish) and interesting...

I had my resits, which weren't that great: I passed one with 41%, and failed the other. However, having changed degrees, dropping the maths part, I was allowed to take the extra ten credits in one of the informatics maths courses, which was nice and easy. It was also called "Counting", if that's any indication of it's difficulty...

This year was good: the winter term's courses were quite interesting, although coursework wasn't, particularly. Coursework also went sort of okay-ish, with some good results and some bad results. Favourite course of the term was probably Introductory Applied Machine Learning (IAML): surprisingly, it was perhaps the most maths-based of all my first term's courses, but the lecturers were ace.

Then the holidays arrived, which was AWESOME. New Year's Eve was a bit of a mess: my flatmates and I started drinking at about 3pm, playing Wizards Staff (google it). We went somewhere for dinner, and I managed to take myself off for a nap at about 10pm, and sleep through actual New Years Eve... Not my best! I did have an awesome second party though, woke up horrificly hungover/still drunk, and got on a coach to the Alps.

30 hours, some vomit, 6 films, and copious quantities of booze and students  later, we FINALLY reached Val Thorens. The weather was good for most of the week, and although there was no real powder to be found, at least the runs had a decent covering of snow, and the music was good...

Then came Semester 2. It was pretty good, courses were fine. Favourite was easily Foundations of Natural Language Processing (FNLP), which had awesome lecturers, awesome coursework, and a generally wicked feel to it... We also had SDP this term, which involved a group of 10 of us using Lego Mindstorms to build a robot that can play football! It was a little stressful at times, and involved some SERIOUS worktiem, but was a great bit of work. Our group bonded really well, and although I only knew 2 of the people in my group at the start, we're now definitely good friends! </cheese> (yeah, I know).

Sooo, that's about it really: got home last Monday, had a fairly chilled week. Trying to juggle quite a lot over the holidays though: building a website for Josephine Knight (josephineknight.co.uk), working for my old school as the IT department rolls out around 90 new machines, and of course, revise like a beast for the 10 exams I have next term :D

Simples, right? Yeah, I hope so...

(I also plan to try and blog a bit more frequently. Might happen, mightn't it?)
